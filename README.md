# Project Description

This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using a Decision Tree Classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm. The model analyzes various academic and socio-demographic factors to identify patterns influencing student outcomes.

The objective is to build an interpretable and efficient predictive model that can assist in early identification of at-risk students and support data-driven academic interventions.
