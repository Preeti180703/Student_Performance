# Project Description

This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using a Decision Tree Classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm. The model analyzes various academic and socio-demographic factors to identify patterns influencing student outcomes.

The objective is to build an interpretable and efficient predictive model that can assist in early identification of at-risk students and support data-driven academic interventions.
# Objectives

* To analyze key factors affecting student performance

* To build and train a Decision Tree classification model

* To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

* To visualize decision rules for better interpretability
 # Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multiple features related to student background and academic behavior, such as:

* Study Time

* Attendance

* Previous Exam Scores

* Parental Education Level

* Internet Access

* Extracurricular Activities

* Target Variable: Student Performance (Pass/Fail or Grade Category)
